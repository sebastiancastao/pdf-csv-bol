# External App PDF Upload Fix - Session Contamination

## Problem Identified
External applications were uploading CSV files successfully but PDF processing was using old files instead of the newly uploaded ones. This caused the system to return previous results instead of processing the new PDF.

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue
- **CSV Processing**: Works correctly because it's designed to merge with existing data
- **PDF Processing**: Fails because `pdf_processor.py` processes the "first PDF found" in the session directory
- **Session Contamination**: External upload functions were missing cleanup logic

### Code Analysis
The regular `upload_file()` function had session contamination detection:
```python
# **SESSION CONTAMINATION DETECTION**: Check for existing files before processing
existing_files = [f for f in os.listdir(processor.session_dir) if not f.startswith('.')]
if existing_files:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  SESSION CONTAMINATION DETECTED!")
    # Clean up existing files to prevent contamination
    for file in existing_files:
        file_path = os.path.join(processor.session_dir, file)
        os.remove(file_path)
```

But the external app upload functions (`upload_base64()` and `upload_attachment()`) were **missing this critical cleanup logic**.

## Solution Implemented

### Fix Applied ‚úÖ
Added the same session contamination detection and cleanup to both external upload functions:

1. **`upload_base64()` function** - Added cleanup before processing base64 encoded PDFs
2. **`upload_attachment()` function** - Added cleanup before processing attachment data

### Code Changes
Both functions now include:
```python
# **SESSION CONTAMINATION DETECTION**: Check for existing files before processing
existing_files = [f for f in os.listdir(processor.session_dir) if not f.startswith('.')]
if existing_files:
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  SESSION CONTAMINATION DETECTED!")
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  Session {processor.session_id} contains existing files: {existing_files}")
    print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è  This may cause same output for different inputs!")
    
    # Clean up existing files to prevent contamination
    for file in existing_files:
        file_path_old = os.path.join(processor.session_dir, file)
        try:
            os.remove(file_path_old)
            print(f"üßπ Removed old file: {file}")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Could not remove {file}: {str(e)}")
```

## Impact

### Before Fix ‚ùå
- External apps would upload new PDFs but process old ones
- Same output returned for different inputs
- Session contamination caused unpredictable behavior

### After Fix ‚úÖ
- External apps now clean up old files before processing new ones
- Each upload processes the correct, newly uploaded file
- Consistent behavior across all upload methods

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test External App PDF Upload**: Upload different PDFs from external apps and verify each processes correctly
2. **Test Session Reuse**: Upload PDF ‚Üí process ‚Üí upload different PDF ‚Üí verify new results
3. **Test All Upload Methods**: Verify `upload_base64()` and `upload_attachment()` both work correctly

## Technical Details

- **Files Modified**: `app.py` (lines ~545 and ~778)
- **Functions Fixed**: `upload_base64()`, `upload_attachment()`
- **Cleanup Logic**: Identical to existing `upload_file()` function
- **Session Safety**: Prevents contamination between uploads
